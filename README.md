# The Gathering Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "Gatherings" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I used the nouns within the assignment, which allowed me to define the manager, member, and organization classes. However I realized after the fact that I could have broke down my classes a little more to achieve a more objected oriented code.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I did not recieve help from any classmates, the only help that I did have was some simple things such as refreshers on javascript but nothing too complex. (More specific I really had to refresh my mind on getters and setters and some arrays information)


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I would say it took me around 4-5 hours in total to complete this assignment


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> I would say this assignment was in the 4-5 range where it wasn't too difficult but it was not the easiest in the world


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I had a little trouble setting this assignment up and one thing I would reccomend future students is to look at the documentation on assignment 1 if you have trouble getting the code to run initially.
